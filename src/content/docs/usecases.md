title: Remote Attestation Use Cases
description: An analysis of when Remote Attestation (RA) is indispensable, when it adds niche protections, and when it is not applicable.
---

Remote Attestation (RA) is not a one-size-fits-all solution.  
In some domains it is **foundational** (TEEs, secrets provisioning), while in others it provides **niche protection** against specific threats (firmware updates, edge compute, IP protection).

This guide walks through these categories to explain why.

---

## Core Use Cases (RA is Fundamental)

### 1. Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)

**_RA is what enables TEEs._**

**Why it matters**  
TEEs provide a hardware-backed isolated environment where code and data are protected from the host OS, hypervisor, and other workloads.

- Without RA, an enclave or secure VM cannot prove to a remote party that it is running the expected signed code.
- The attestation proof is what anchors trust in the TEE — it is the cryptographic guarantee that the code and environment haven’t been tampered with.

**Context**

- TEEs require specialized hardware (Intel SGX, AMD SEV, ARM TrustZone) and may impose performance or usability constraints.
- Adoption depends on:
  - Threat model (what adversaries you want to defend against)
  - Security scope (which assets or workloads need protection)
  - Business context (does the value of confidentiality justify the cost/complexity?)

**Fit for RA**

- If you’ve adopted confidential computing, RA is non-negotiable: it is the mechanism that proves trust in the TEE.

**Where our service helps**

- Scales attestation and verification across heterogeneous hardware vendors (SGX, SEV, TrustZone).
- Simplifies orchestration and key distribution for multiple TEEs.
- Reduces operational complexity by centralizing attestation checks.
- Accelerates adoption by making TEE verification easy to integrate into business workflows.

### 2. Runtime Secure Provisioning

**_Secrets must only be delivered to trustworthy environments._**

At runtime, your workloads need secrets:

- Service credentials (DB connection strings, OAuth tokens)
- Application private keys (for TLS, JWTs, SSH)
- Data encryption keys (wrapping/unwrapping DEKs, often via KMS)
- Licensing/configuration data (in high-value software/IP protection scenarios)
- ML model weights
- etc ...

Even after credential evaluation, delivering those secrets without cryptographic verification of the target environment means if the OS/hypervisor is compromised, attackers can exfiltrate secrets via memory scraping, debugger hooks, or privileged process injection. With RA, you can ensure those secrets are only released into workloads that prove they’re running in the expected environment.

**Deployment Models**

- **Into a TEE (enclave/VM)**

  - Strongest model: RA verifies enclave measurement (e.g., Intel SGX MRENCLAVE, AMD SEV-SNP/TDX PCRs).
  - Secrets never leave enclave-protected memory.
  - Example: Workload inside an AWS Nitro Enclave → Vault checks attestation evidence → only then releases secrets.

- **Into an attested platform/application (non-TEE)**
  - Useful when TEEs are too restrictive.
  - RA is done at VM/host level (TPM quotes, PCR policy checks) + layered controls (disk encryption, SELinux/AppArmor, hardened OS).
  - For threat models like “only accept my golden AMI + patched kernel,” this may be sufficient.

**Fit for RA**  
RA goes beyond endpoint and application security by enforcing secrets release only into cryptographically verified, uncompromised states.

---

**Where our service helps**

- Simplifies the attestation + provisioning flow.
- Integrates directly with key vaults (HashiCorp Vault, AWS KMS, HSM-backed systems).
- Enforces least-privilege delivery of secrets.
- Enables attestation-based authentication for runtime systems.

## Combination Use Cases (RA can provide an additional layer of security)

### 3. Trusted Edge Compute (AI/Privacy)

**_RA helps reduce risk and provide stronger assurances for sensitive workloads at the edge._**

**Why it matters**

- Edge nodes increasingly perform sensitive operations such as AI inference or processing private customer data.
- Even with network encryption, OS hardening, and endpoint protections, compromised nodes can lead to theft of models, customer data, or intellectual property.
- RA provides cryptographic evidence that a workload is running in the expected environment, helping reduce the likelihood of breaches and IP leakage.

**Fit for RA**

- RA can be a **risk mitigation tool** rather than a regulatory requirement.
- Even without full TEEs on every edge node, RA combined with strong configuration and system controls allows operators to verify that workloads are untampered.
- Supports audits and internal compliance by providing measurable proof of runtime integrity.
- Enables policies that enforce sensitive data or models are only released to attested nodes.

**Where our service helps**

- Simplifies deployment and orchestration of attested workloads at edge scale.
- Enables privacy-preserving or IP-sensitive compute without requiring every node to run heavyweight TEEs.
- Centralizes verification and monitoring of attestation evidence across a heterogeneous edge environment.
- Supports integration with AI/ML workflows and secure data pipelines.

## Niche Use Cases (RA is Protective but Context-Dependent)

### 3. OTA Firmware / Bootloader / OS / Hypervisor / Application Updates

- **Why it matters**: Updates are a common attack vector — RA can enforce that the component verifying updates is itself trusted.
- **Threats mitigated**:
  - **Update hijacking (MiTM)**: If an OS verifies user-space updates but is compromised, RA ensures that the update verifier itself (OS or bootloader) is trusted.
  - **Rollback/downgrade attacks**: Prevents devices from pretending they are on an older version to accept vulnerable firmware.
  - **Fake/cloned devices**: RA can block attackers from impersonating a device to fetch valid update packages.
  - **Updating in an untrusted state**: Stops patching systems that are already compromised beyond repair.
- **Fit for RA**: Best applied when one layer validates updates for another (e.g., bootloader validates firmware, OS validates user-space apps). For IoT, OS checks on user-space updates are the most realistic target.
- **Where our service helps**: Orchestrates scalable RA for fleets of devices, integrates attestation into update workflows.

### 5. IP Protection & Licensing

- **Why it matters**: Vendors want to protect intellectual property (models, algorithms, licensed binaries) from exfiltration.
- **Threats**:
  - Memory dumping, debugger abuse, OS compromise enabling exfiltration.
- **Fit for RA**:
  - Similar to secrets provisioning — only deliver IP (e.g., a model) if the runtime attests it as trustworthy.
  - Enforcement strength depends: user-space logic can gate access, but **true protection requires cryptographic enforcement** (e.g., binding decryption keys to a TPM/TEE state).
- **Where our service helps**: Provides the attestation backbone to make “the model only decrypts in a verified state” feasible at scale.

---

### 6. Supply Chain Integrity

- **Why it matters**: Protects against tampering in the narrow window _after_ shipping but _before_ delivery, or runtime malicious modification.
- **Fit for RA**: Mostly relevant to vendors, not customers. Offers a way to prove devices arrive in a trusted state.
- **Limitation**: This is a niche, vendor-driven case. Few organizations will adopt a new service just for this.

---

### 7. Bootkits & Driver Abuse (UEFI, BYOVD)

- **Threats**:
  - UEFI bootkits like BlackLotus, LoJax, MoonBounce bypass Secure Boot and TPM.
  - **BYOVD (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver)**: Windows loads any CA-signed driver, even if vulnerable.
- **Fit for RA**:
  - Bootkits: questionable — many bypass RA’s underlying trust anchors (TPM/Secure Boot). RA alone wouldn’t save you here.
  - BYOVD: stronger fit — RA could detect “extra” drivers present (e.g., drivers D (with vulnerability) in addition to expected A, B, C).
- **Where our service helps**: Detects runtime state mismatches that signatures alone can’t flag.

---

## Summary

- **Strong Fit**: TEEs, secure provisioning.
- **Niche Fit**: OTA updates, trusted edge compute, IP protection, supply chain, BYOVD.

RA is indispensable where it underpins the trust model (TEEs, secrets), valuable as a safeguard in certain update/IP/privacy scenarios, and irrelevant where attacks bypass RA’s assumptions.
