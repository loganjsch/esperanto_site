## The Scenario…

You need to provision secrets or process sensitive data across clouds and edge.

But before you can, you have to **trust the platform your code is running on**.

But each environment has its own attestation scheme - AWS Nitro, Azure SEV-SNP, even custom TPM based checks.

Now you’re buried in cryptography, APIs, and one-off integrations. It’s inconsistent, expensive, and impossible to scale.

## What Esperanto Does

Esperanto simplifies platform trust by streamlining remote attestation (RA) across any hardware or cloud.

It collects and verifies cryptographic proofs of your platform’s integrity — firmware, OS/kernel, and virtualization or TEE layers — so you can be confident that your workloads only run on attested, trusted platforms, wherever they’re deployed.

- **Single Endpoints** — A unified API to attest TEEs, TPMs, and other hardware-backed roots of trust.
- **Dynamic Verification** - Perform just-in-time checks before releasing secrets, models, or any sensitive workload.
- **Standards Aligned** — built on the IETF RATS framework, no proprietary lock-in.

Esperanto is your attestation engine — the underlying layer that manages collection and verification of proofs. Whether you want to build new products, enhance data security for your customers, or seamlessly add hardware-backed trust into your CI/CD pipeline, Esperanto makes it simple.

## See It in Action

Esperanto is in **development** — while the demo is a proof of concept and demonstration of use, it is **currently** wildly insecure, bloated, and probably very buggy.
