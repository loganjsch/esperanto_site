## The Scenario…

You need to provision secrets or process sensitive data across clouds and edge.

But before you can, you have to **trust the platform your code is running on**.

But each environment has its own attestation scheme:  
AWS Nitro, GCP’s flow, Azure SEV-SNP, custom edge TPM based checks.

Suddenly you’re buried in cryptography, APIs, and one-off integrations.  
It’s inconsistent, expensive, and impossible to scale.

## What Esperanto Does

Esperanto unifies Remote Attestation (RA) of the firmware, OS/kernel, and virtualization/TEE your workloads run on.

- **One API, all platforms** — TPMs, TEEs, enclaves.
- **Simple enrollment + just-in-time checks** before sensitive operations.
- **Standards aligned** — built on the IETF RATS framework, no proprietary lock-in.

Just:

1. **Enroll** a platform once in its trusted state.
2. **Attest** it on demand before releasing secrets, models, or workloads.

---

## Why It Matters

Without RA:

- Secrets can land on compromised hosts.
- Tampered firmware or kernels can go undetected.
- Attackers can persist below the application layer, invisible to monitoring.

With Esperanto:

- Trust enforcement is **unified and automated**.
- Developers don’t need to be crypto experts.
- Security leaders get confidence that sensitive workloads only run on verified platforms.

## See It in Action

Esperanto is in **development** — while the demo is a proof of concept and demonstration of use, it is **currently** wildly insecure, bloated, and probably very buggy.

**Esperanto is built for developers inside enterprises — and the security leaders they support — to make Remote Attestation practical at scale.**
